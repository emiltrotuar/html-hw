		<strong>Which microphone is best suited to?</strong>
		<p>It is important to bear in mind that there are no set rules when selecting a microphone. For example, some internationally recognised vocalists use instrument microphones for world tours. Sound quality is largely a matter of personal taste. Some things do need to be considered such as dynamic v’s condenser, or whether the microphone you require needs to be rugged. This website has been designed to guide you towards finding the most suitable microphone to your needs.</p>

		<strong>Which Shure microphone can I use for podcasting?</strong>
		<p>Many Shure microphones can be used for podcasts. If a quick and simple Plug & Play solution is what you are after then the PG27-USB or PG42-USB are ideal. If you already have an XLR microphone and wish to use it for your podcasts we’d recommend buying an X2U. This is an XLR to USB converter, cutting out the need for you to buy a sound card. It offers great benefits including zero latency monitoring.</p>

		<strong>How can I connect my microphone to my computer?</strong>
		<p>The fastest and simplest way of connecting your XLR microphone to your computer (if you do not already have a soundcard) is using a Shure X2U – an XLR to USB converter.</p>

		<strong>Which is the best microphone for me?</strong>
		<p>This is probably THE most frequently asked to Shure engineers - nevertheless there is no generally accepted answer as a lot of it goes down to personal taste. There are standard recommendations for the different areas of application. We can however recommend you a suitable microphone with our product videos and microphone finder.</p>

		<strong>What is the best position to place my microphone for miking drums?</strong>
		<p>Again there are no set rules but we do have a drum microphone techniques guide with advice from professionals.</p>

		<strong>What is the difference between an SM57 and an SM58?</strong>
		<p>The SM58 is designed for vocals and the SM57 for instruments. However, this doesn’t mean you can’t use the SM57 for vocals and vice versa.The main difference is that the SM58 features a presence peak (to boost voacals) whereas the SM57 has a flat frequency response.</p>

		<strong>Does the presence of phantom power effect/damage balanced, low impedance dynamic microphones?</strong>
		<p>It is not possible to damage or impair the performance of a balanced microphone which is correctly connected to any standard phantom supply.</p>

		<strong>Can I operate more than one wireless mic with only one receiver?</strong>
		<p>No, each wireless transmitter needs to have its own receiver.</p>

		<strong>What is the range of a wireless microphone?</strong>
		<p>Transmission range is greatly affected by the local RF environment, e.g., range in London is short; range in the Sahara Desert is long.Typical range for a professional wireless mic is up to 300 feet (100 metres).</p>

		<strong>Can I make my wired mic into a wireless mic?</strong>
		<p>No. Due to the way the mics are manufactured, you can’t convert a wired mic into a wireless version.</p>

		<strong>Can I mix and match Shure’s different wireless platforms?</strong>
		<p>No, only transmitters and receivers from the same platform will work. E.g., A PGX transmitter will not work with an SLX receiver, but will work with a PGX receiver.</p>

		<strong>What are sound isolating earphones? </strong>
		<p>Sound isolating earphones were originally developed as Personal Monitor Systems to allow musicians to hear their own performances in loud onstage environments. Sound isolating earphones work by using soft, pliable sleeves to block background noise, allowing small, high-performance drivers to deliver incredibly precise sound directly to the ear. These professional-quality earphones are now available for use with all of your portable digital devices.</p>
